## What Is Neem?
The scientific name of Neem is Azadirachta Indica. It’s a tree in the mahogany family Meliaceae. It grows in the Indian subcontinent, i.e. India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and Bangladesh. It usually grows in tropical and semi-tropical regions.

Neem trees have the ability to survive through the droughts and in dry regions. Neem can also grow in different types of soils, though well-drained deep and sandy soils are the best at nurturing neem trees. Neem is also able to tolerate high temperatures, but it is unable to tolerate temperatures lower than 4 ℃. Neem also does not require a specific type of water, therefore, it is able to survive with the least amount of water.

All in all, it can be said that neem is a very undemanding tree and it is able to survive with the barest of caretaking.

Neem oil is extracted from the neem tree’s fruits and seeds.
